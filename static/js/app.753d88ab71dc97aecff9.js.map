(showModal) so all modals will show when you set this to true. \nThe solution is to isolate each button within it's own component which has it's own showModal attribute rather than emitting it to the\nparent:\n\nVue.component('btn',{\n  template: `<div><button @click=\"showModal = true\"><slot></slot></button>   \n    <modal v-if=\"showModal\">I am a modal for {{button}}</modal></div>`,\n  props: ['button'],\n  data(){\n    return {\n      showModal: false\n    }\n  }\n});\n \n\nAnd here's the updated JSBin\n\nIf you need different modals for each button type, then simply create two button components edit-button, delete-button etc\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/modal.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var
